#Cryptography
##Objectives
Use pass by value and pass by reference subroutines to decrypt a message, given both the message and the key it was "XORed" with.
##Design
Because all the hardware was provided a flowchart of the assembly code is the only preliminary design needed to begin building the decrypt.
